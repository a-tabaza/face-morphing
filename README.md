# Face Morphing with Python
Face morphing is a technique that involves blending two or more images of faces together in order to create a new image that appears to be a hybrid of the original faces. [Code Source](https://github.com/Azmarie/Face-Morphing/)
### Libraries Used:
 1. glob 
 2. os 
 3. sys 
 4. PIL 
 5. OpenCV 
 6. imutils 
 7. dlib 
 8. skimage 
 9. matplotlib 
 10. numpy  
 11. random
 12. math
 
 #### Concepts & Ideas used:
  1. Basic Image data manipulation and processing using OpenCV and PIL
  2. Facial Landmarks Recognition using pretrained models from dlib library
  3. Delaunay triangulation using OpenCV
  4. Advanced morphology for blending and warping using OpenCV
